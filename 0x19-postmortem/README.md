## Postmortem / Incidence Report
Software systems sommetimes fail and it can be due to some diiferent factors that can include:

            1.Human errors
            2.Security issues i.e cybercrime
            3.Bugs and malware
            4.Network traffic issues such as firewall failures, component failures such as servers and routers, bottlenecks and high latency.
            5.Lack of skilled manpower to run the system that involves lack of leadership that can lead to missed opportunities and unforseen problems that could have been avoided.
            6.Hardware failures 
            7.Natural disasters 
            8.Identity thief and phising
            9. Inadequate use of resources
            10. Poor planning and inability to overcome challenges like balancing the clients needs with those of the developer
            11. Poor communication when teams dont share information or coordinate their efforts, they can produce a high-quality product

## When you fail you get back up, shake the dust off and begin again atleast this time you wount be starting from scratch you have some experience.

Any great Software developer should learn from his/her mistakes and ask for assistance if they are stuck or they dont know how to go about a project.

## Failure is not the opposite of success its part of success and in failing you learn new ways that wont work.

A postmortem is a written record of an incident, its impact, action taken to mitigate the root cause(s) and follow up actions to prevent te incident from recurring. it is a tool widely used in the tech industry. After any process failures, the team(s) in charge of the system will write a report/summary whose main goal is to:

* To provide more robust,, stable, bug free software by understanding why we failed in the first place and ow to avoid such mistakes in the future.
* Learn every lesson we can from the outages and emergencies to ensure that they dont happen again In the process you can catch bugs you dint know about and fix the processes which were prone to cause issues early.
